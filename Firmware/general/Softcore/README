The Softcore uses the VexRISCV processor from the SpinalHDL project by Charles Papon
(https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv) and builds a microcontroller that runs from the ROM of the MAX10 FPGA.

The microcontroller is available in the output file VexRISCVSoftcore.v and provides an APB master bus to control the 
components of the time distribution system.
